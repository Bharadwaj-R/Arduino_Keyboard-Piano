# Arduino Keyboard Piano
### Simple IoT piano project, using Arduino Uno

***Working :***  
Once we switch on the Arduino Uno and upload the code, the serial monitor waits for the user input. Based on the no. of characters given as input, it plays the corresponding note. 

***Versions***  
- v1.0.0 - Only one character input, need to press enter key after every input.  
- v1.0.1 - Multiple character input, can press the input once the tone order is set. Still need to press enter after every combination.  

***Motivation behind the project :***  
The basic motivation beind this project is to help a few of my CS friends with their IoT project. Them being CS students, they couldn't understand much about sensors and stuff. Hence, they approached me for help (I'm an ECE Undergrad. Refer [My GitHub profile](https://github.com/Bharadwaj-R) for more info about me)
